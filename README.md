## GitHub Activity Summary
Since some networks block external images, here is a text-based summary that always works:

- Public Repositories: Automatically visible on your profile  
- Contribution Calendar: Visible on your profile page  
- Total Contributions (Year): Visible on your profile  
- Languages Used: Viewable under each repo  
- Commit Activity: Shown by GitHub natively  
- Streak: Available under contributions graph  

Everything can be checked **directly on your GitHub profile** without any external images.
